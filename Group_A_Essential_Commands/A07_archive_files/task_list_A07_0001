Task List A07_1



Sonny Stitt is the Director of Cloud Computing at Microsoft by day, 
and he holds the second alto saxophone chair in the Bill Eckstine Big Band by night.
He want compress /home/sstitt/Documents into a tar archive called MyDocs.tar.
What command will he run?
tar cvf MyDocs.tar ~/Documents

After compressing the folder above, Sonny decides that he wants to use gzip compression.
How would he alter the command above to use gzip compression?
tar cvzf MyDocs.tar.gz ~/Documents

Though gzip compressions is very good, Sonny learns that bz2 offers much greater compression ratios.
How would Sonny change the second command above to use bz2 compression?
tar cvjf MyDocs.tar.bz2 ~/Documents

Sonny does not want to take anyone's word that bz2 offers greater compression than gzip compressions.
So on Sunday December 4, 2022, he actually compressed his Documents directory twice:
the 1st time using gzip compression, the second time using bz2 compression.
Here are the results:
1.) no compresssion => tar cvf MyDocs.tar ~/Documents => MyDocs.tar = 108.8 MB
2.) gzip compression => tar cvzf MyDocs.tar.gz ~/Documents => MyDocs.tar.gz = 66.0 MB
3.) bz2 compression => tar cvjf MyDocs.tar.bz2 ~/Documents =>	MyDocs.tar.bz2 = 55.4 MB
