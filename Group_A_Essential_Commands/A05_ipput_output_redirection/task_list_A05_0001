Use input-output redirection (e.g. >, >>, |, 2>)


Ella Fitzgerald is the Director of IT at Columbia University.
She wants to create a new empty file called "forTheDirectorsOnly.txt".
What command will she run?

Next, Ella wants to redirect the standard output to forDirectorsOnly.txt
to enter the phrase "This document is Top Secret" into the txt file.
What command would she use?
echo "This document is Top Secret" > forDirectorsOnly.txt

What command would Ella run to ensure that forDirectorsOnly.txt has been updated correctly?
cat forDirectorsOnly

Ella now wants to add this line to forDirectorsOnly.txt:
"This document must be kept in a secure environment at all times."
What command would she run to append this line to the txt file?
echo "This document must be kept in a secure environment at all times." >> forDirectorsOnly.txt
cat forDirectorsOnly (to verify that the line was added correctly)

Ella now wants to learn how to perform input redirection.
How would she use input redirection to see only the first line of the txt file?
What command would she run?
She would use input redirection with the "head" command.
